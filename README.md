# Expo DocumentPicker Android - Inconsistent Failure to Return Results

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android where the picker sometimes fails to return a result, leaving the app in a seemingly unresponsive state. The promise from `useDocumentPickerAsync` never resolves, and no errors are thrown.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Run the `bug.js` example on an Android device or emulator.
2. Attempt to select a file using the DocumentPicker.
3. The picker may or may not return a result. If it fails, the app will appear stuck.

## Potential Causes

- Possible race condition within the Android implementation of the DocumentPicker.
- Issues with file permissions or system resources.
- Interaction with other libraries or Expo modules.

## Proposed Solution (bugSolution.js)

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` attempts to mitigate this issue by implementing a timeout mechanism. If the DocumentPicker doesn't return a result within a reasonable time, the promise rejects with an error. This allows the app to handle the failure gracefully.

## Additional Notes

- This bug appears to be sporadic, making it difficult to track down with traditional debugging techniques.
- The timeout solution is a workaround, not a permanent fix. A deeper investigation into the root cause of the issue is necessary.
- Consider alternative file picking libraries or methods if this issue persistently affects your application.
